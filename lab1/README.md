### Download our sample code
Find out more about the sample code [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/get-started-exercise.html).

Note: We have tweaked the examples slightly.

* In the terminal, paste and run the following code to setup the Flink 1.6.2 environment and to compile the Kinesis connector for Flink.

```
cd ~/environment
git clone https://github.com/dbayardAWS/kinesis-labs.git
```

## Create Kinesis Streams for input and output

```
# change DB to your initials before running this
export INITIALS=DB

```

![screenshot](images/stream1.png)

```
echo Initials=$INITIALS
aws kinesis create-stream \
--stream-name ExampleInputStream$INITIALS \
--shard-count 1 

aws kinesis create-stream \
--stream-name ExampleOutputStream$INITIALS \
--shard-count 1 

```

![screenshot](images/stream2.png)


### Edit and launch the stocks.py Provider

* In the Cloud9 navigator on the left-hand side, expand the kinesis-labs folder, then the src folder.  Then double-click on the stock.py file to open it in a tab in the editor.

![screenshot](images/stock1.png)

* Find the StreamName parameter in the stock.py code and append your initials to the Stream name (to match the name of the kinesis stream you created with the "aws kinesis create-stream" command above).

![screenshot](images/stock2.png)

* Then use the File..Save menu to save the modified stock.py file

![screenshot](images/stock3.png)

* Use the + icon to open up a new terminal tab

![screenshot](images/stock4.png)

* In the new terminal tab, run these commands:

```
cd kinesis-labs/src
python stock.py

```

![screenshot](images/stock5.png)


### Edit and launch the readStream Consumer

* In the Cloud9 navigator on the left-hand side, expand the kinesis-labs folder, then the src folder.  Then double-click on the readStream.py file to open it in a tab in the editor.

![screenshot](images/read1.png)

* Find the my_stream_name parameter in the readStream.py code and append your initials to the Stream name (to match the name of the kinesis input stream you created with the "aws kinesis create-stream" command above).

Note: at this point, the my_stream_name should be set to the ExampleInputStream[Initials].  In a later exercise, we will point this consumer to the ExampleOutputStream but not yet.

![screenshot](images/read2.png)

* Then use the File..Save menu to save the modified readStream.py file

![screenshot](images/read3.png)

* Use the + icon to open up a new terminal tab

![screenshot](images/read4.png)

* In the new terminal tab, run these commands:

```
cd kinesis-labs/src
python readStream.py

```

![screenshot](images/read5.png)

You should see the messages from the Kinesis stream printed out to the console.

* In the terminal tab running the readStream.py, type ctrl-c to stop it.

![screenshot](images/read5.png)


### Edit the Getting Started KDAJ application and compile it

* In the navigator on the left-hand side, expand the kinesis-labs folder, then the src folder, all the way as shown in the below screensot until you get to the BasicStreamingJob.java file.  Double-click on the file to open it in a tab in the editor.

![screenshot](images/started1.png)

* Find the inputStreamName and outputStreamName parameters in the java code and append your initials to the Stream name (to match the name of the kinesis streams you created with the "aws kinesis create-stream" command above).

Note: Be sure to edit both the inputStreamName and outputStreamName

![screenshot](images/started2.png)

* NOTE: If you are not running in the AWS region 'us-east-1', then you need to edit the java source code to change the "region" variable to the correct region.

![screenshot](images/started2a.png)

* Then use the File..Save menu to save the modified BasicStreamingJob.java file

![screenshot](images/started3.png)

* In your left-most Terminal tab (or open a new Terminal tab if you wish), run these commands to compile and build your KDAJ application:

```
cd ~/environment/kinesis-labs/src/amazon-kinesis-data-analytics-java-examples/GettingStarted/
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=/home/ec2-user/environment/flink-release-1.6.2/flink-connectors/flink-connector-kinesis/target/flink-connector-kinesis_2.11-1.6.2.jar -DpomFile=/home/ec2-user/environment/flink-release-1.6.2/flink-connectors/flink-connector-kinesis/target/dependency-reduced-pom.xml
mvn package

```

![screenshot](images/started4.png)

### Create an s3 bucket to upload code

* Using the same Terminal tab you just used to compile/build your KDAJ application, run these 2 sets commands to create a new S3 bucket.  Be sure to redefine the lowercaseusername to your username:

```
# change "dbayard" to your username (in lowercase, no spaces) before running this
export lowercaseusername=dbayard

```

```
echo lowercaseusername=$lowercaseusername
aws s3 mb s3://lab-kdaj-app-code-$lowercaseusername

```

![screenshot](images/s31.png)

### copy the jar file to the s3 bucket

* Using the same Terminal tab, run these commands to copy the generated .jar file your KDAJ application to the s3 bucket:

```
echo lowercaseusername=$lowercaseusername
cd ~/environment/kinesis-labs/src/amazon-kinesis-data-analytics-java-examples/GettingStarted/target/
aws s3 rm s3://lab-kdaj-app-code-$lowercaseusername/java-getting-started-1.0.jar
aws s3 cp aws-kinesis-analytics-java-apps-1.0.jar s3://lab-kdaj-app-code-$lowercaseusername/java-getting-started-1.0.jar

```

![screenshot](images/s32.png)

### use the UI to define the KDAJ application

* In the AWS Console, use the Services menu and navigate to the Kinesis console.  One way to do so, is to expand the Services top menu and type "Kinesis" in the service search field.

![screenshot](images/kin1.png)

* In the left-hand column, click on "Data Analytics"

* Then click on "Create application"

![screenshot](images/kin2.png)

* On the Create Application page, enter "kdaj_app_INTITALS" for the application name, where your replace INITIALS with your initials.

* Enter a description of your liking

* Choose Apache Flink 1.6 for the Runtime

* Leave the default of "Create / update IAM..." for the Access permisions

* Click Create application

![screenshot](images/kin3.png)

* Now the application is created but it is not yet configured.  Click Configure

![screenshot](images/kin4.png)

* On the Configure application page, pick the S3 bucket you created earlier.  It will be named something like lab-kdaj-app-code-[lowercaseusername].

* For the S3 object path, enter this value:

```
java-getting-started-1.0.jar
```

* Expand Snapshots and disable them

* Expand Monitoring and enable Cloudwatch Logging.  Leave the level of logging to WARN for now.

Hint: if you need to debug why your KDAJ application isn't working, you may need to change this INFO at a later point.

* Click the Update button


![screenshot](images/kin5.png)

* Now run the application by clicking the Run button and when it asks if you are sure, click the Run button again

![screenshot](images/kin6.png)

At this point, your Flink application is starting.  It may take a few minutes to start.

* Wait until the Application Status says running

![screenshot](images/kin7.png)

### Add permissions to the generated IAM policy for your application
Even though the KDAJ Console generated an IAM policy for your application, the Console does not know that your java code wants to read the ExampleInputStream kinesis stream and write to the ExampleOutputStream kinesis stream.  As such, the Console UI didn't add those permissions to your applications IAM policy.

Let's now edit the application's policy to add permissions so that the application can run OK.


Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.

Choose Policies. Choose the kinesis-analytics-service-kdaj_app_[INITIALS]-[REGION] policy that the console created for you in the previous section.  Hint: type "kdaj" in the search box.

On the Summary page, choose Edit policy. Choose the JSON tab.

Add the highlighted section of the following policy example to the policy. Replace the sample account IDs (012345678901) with your account ID. 
arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:946160804628:stream/ExampleInputStreamDB

{
            "Sid": "ReadInputStream",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kinesis:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:535356700373:stream/ExampleInputStream"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "WriteOutputStream",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "kinesis:*",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:535356700373:stream/ExampleOutputStream"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt789",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "*"
            ]
        }


### Edit the readStream.py consumer

* Go back to your Cloud9 IDE browser page.  Click on the existing tab for the readStream.py file.

* Edit readStream.py file by commenting out the line that sets my_stream_name to the ExampleInputStream and uncommenting the line that sets the my_stream_name to the ExampleOutputStream

![screenshot](images/read7.png)

* Save the changes

![screenshot](images/read7b.png)

* Run the file in a terminal tab with this command:

```
cd ~/environment/kinesis-labs/src
python readStream.py

```

```
echo INITIALS=$INITIALS
aws kinesisanalyticsv2 list-applications

aws kinesisanalyticsv2 update-application \
      --application-name kdaj_app_$INITIALS \
      --current-application-version-id 5

```
